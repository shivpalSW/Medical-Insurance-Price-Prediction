# Medical-Insurance-Price-Prediction
------------------------------------------------
* Medical Insurance Price Prediction using Regression Algorithms


## Problem Statement: 
------------------------------------------------
Different persons have different body types and different living culture. So the diseases effection on them or the treatment expense for them also vary with respect to these situations. For example medical insurance premium of a smoker person may require more amount than a normal person without any bad habbits, since the probability of occurance of chronic disease are more for smokers. The main aim of this application is to help users to get overall idea about the appropriate medical insurance premium suitable for their living culture, gender and some other factors.
